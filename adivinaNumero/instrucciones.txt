# Guess the Number

Things to consider in the program logic:

1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100
2. Save the player's current guess number, starting with guess 1.
3. Give the player a way to guess the number.
4. Once the number is entered, record it somewhere so the player can see their guesses.
5. Next, check if the number is correct.

6. If correct:
i. Display a congratulatory message
ii. Make it impossible for the player to enter any more guesses.
iii. Display a control that allows the player to play again.

7. If incorrect and the player has more guesses remaining:
i. Tell the player they failed.
ii. Let the player try again.
iii. Increase the number of attempts by 1.

8. If the player fails and has no attempts left:
i. Tell the player that the game is over.
ii. Make it so the player cannot enter any more attempts.
iii. Display a control that allows the player to restart the game.

9. Once the game restarts, make sure the game logic and UI are fully reset, then return to step 1.
